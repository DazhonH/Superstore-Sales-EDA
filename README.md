# Exploratory Data Analysis: Superstore Sales - Python & Tableau
## Introduction
Exploratory data analysis utilizing Python to clean and visualize the data. Once data was analyzed, I visualized the data frame using Tableau Public.
## Background
* "Superstore Sales" generally refers to the sales data and performance of a superstore or a large retail store that offers a wide range of products and merchandise. These superstores are typically known for their extensive inventory, competitive pricing, and one-stop shopping experience.

* Analyzing superstore sales data is essential for store owners, managers, and analysts to understand the store's performance, identify trends, and make informed business decisions.
